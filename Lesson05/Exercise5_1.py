# Write a class representing two-dimensional vector (with x and y coordinates),
# which supports the following operations:
# 1. Addition of two vectors: v1 + v2
# 2. Subtraction of two vectors: v1 - v2
# 3. Dot product of two vectors:
#     a. Using operator v1 * v2
#     b. Using method v1.dot(v2)
#     c. Using class method Vector2d.dot(v1, v2)
# 4. Vector length property:
#     a. v.length
# 5. String representation: str(v)
