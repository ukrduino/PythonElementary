# Write classes of the following heroes: Warrior, Mage, and Archer.
# All classes have health points (HP) and magic energy (mana).
# There are three different types of magic: Fire, Ice and Arcane;
# Fire magic has the spell fireball, Ice magic has the spell freeze and
# Arcane magic has the spell black hole.
# The Warrior is furious and can use Fire magic as well as his hammer;
# The Archer is calm and can use Ice magic in addition to his arrows;
# The Mag can use all types of magic.
# Each magic spell costs an arbitrary amount of magic energy and can be
# cast only if there is enough mana. Use magic mixins to reduce repetitive code.
